    <h2>What <em>is</em> Lorem Ipsum</h2>
    <!-- <em> is emphasis or italics <i> also works-->
    <p><em>Lorem ipsum</em>, or <em>lipsum</em> as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.
        The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of 
        <em>Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</em> for use in a type specimen book.</p>
    <!-- <strong> makes things bold <b> also works-->
